# Kotlin List Transformation: `map` vs Manual Iteration

This example demonstrates two approaches to transforming a list in Kotlin: using the built-in `map` function and manually iterating through the list.  The `map` function offers a more concise and functional approach, while manual iteration might be preferred in certain scenarios where more control is needed.

## Bug (or rather, a less efficient approach):
The 'bug' is using manual iteration instead of the `map` function for list transformation. This is less concise and can be less efficient for larger lists.

## Solution:
Using Kotlin's `map` function provides a more readable and efficient way to achieve the same result.
